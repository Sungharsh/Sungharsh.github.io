It is used to build UI part of the application. React has gained more popularity than any other libraries in short span.</p>\n<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>\n<p>ReactJS is different from any other frameworks because it uses JSX, Virtual DOM, Diffing Algorithm, and its planning to bring in many other futuristic implementations in the current stack. React is growing popularity more and more just because of performance, speed, and seamless integrations capabilities.</p>\n<p>React has made revolutionary changes in version 16.8 by bringing React Hooks which made ease of implementing and ease of learning its concepts.</p>\n<p>Further in 20-10-2020 React has launched v17 a major relace version, although there were no new features in this version, with this, they have simplified some of the concepts like we do not need to import react in a component and we can still use JSX in it, this helps feature generations to focus on learning in depth skills in React.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, React has paved ways to use more and more JavaScript as a predominant solution for integrating our futuristic systems.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to learn React, but its always good to read the official documentation hear <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">https://reactjs.org/</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"react"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2199005656"]}
